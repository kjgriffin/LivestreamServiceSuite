And in one Lord Jesus Christ,
     the only-begotten Son of God,
     begotten of His Father before all worlds,
     God of God, Light of Light,
     very God of very God,
     begotten, not made,
     being of one substance with the Father,
     by whom all things were made;
     who for us men and for our salvation
       came down from heaven
     and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary
     and was made man;
     and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate.
     He suffered and was buried.
     And the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures
          and ascended into heaven
     and sits at the right hand of the Father.
     And He will come again with glory to judge
       both the living and the dead,
     whose kingdom will have no end.

And I believe in the Holy Spirit,
     the Lord and giver of life,
     who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
     who with the Father and the Son together
       is worshiped and glorified,
     who spoke by the prophets.
     And I believe in one holy Christian
       and apostolic Church,
     I acknowledge one Baptism for the
       remission of sins,
     and I look for the resurrection of the dead
     and the life of the world to come. Amen.
